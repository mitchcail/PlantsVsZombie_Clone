The goal of this team project is to implement a puzzle version of the popular Plants vs Zombies (PvZ) game. PvZ is a game in the tower defense genre available for most gaming platforms. If you don't know the game or don't own the suitable platform, find out more here: http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1

The basic idea of the game is that you drop plants with various magical powers in your garden to defend against invading zombies. One plant, the sunflower, gives you sun points that you can use to buy more plants. Other plants shoot at the zombies at various time intervals or damage points. Other plants prevent or slow down the advance of the zombies. Plants have a different cost in points depending on their type. Also, once you drop a plant you must wait some time before plants of its type are available again for planting. This wait time also varies depending on the type of plant. There are also different kinds of zombies: some more resistant to damage, some faster, some that aren't slowed down by certain obstacles, some that have weapons of their own, etc. When a zombie gets near a plant, it starts chewing on it until the plant is destroyed...

The game has multiple levels. At the beginning of each level, the kinds of monsters that will be attacking are presented to the player, to help him/her select the kinds of plants he/she wishes to use for the level. During the level, zombies come in attacking waves. The level is won if the plants manage to destroy all the attacking zombies. The level is lost if one or many zombies manage to get through the plants and reach the end of the garden, thereby entering the house and eating brains!

There are of course many more subtleties to the game, but you should at least cover the features listed above. But one main aspect of the version of the game you are asked to implement is that it is in puzzle form, i.e. it is not real time. The player is prompted to enter a move, and nothing moves or is changed while the player makes a decision. This will allow you to work on a text-based version of the game in the early part of the project. Also, only in such a puzzle version would it make sense to ask for unlimited undo and redo actions as well the possibility to save and load a game at any point...

Finally, you are asked to work on a game level editing tool. For each level, the user should be able to specify the type and number of zombies, as well as the timing of the waves of arrival of the zombies.
