GameWindow:	@param Level l a level to visually generate on the JFrame

The GameWindow class acts as the GUI for program. There are three main components to this GUI: methods for initializing the board, methods for 
dealing with interactions required by the controlling (such as setting the action listener for all of the buttons in the VIEW to go to the controller),
and methods for dealing with whatever input comes through the update method. The methods for initialization the board dealing with creating and adding a 
two dimensional array to a layeredPane and initialization a single dimension boolean array to determine how many rows are enabled on the given level. The
initialization methods also generate the menubar that will be added to the game. The controller specific methods deal with things like providing the controller
with information on the VIEW (if ever needed), refreshing the view (this should occur whenever a button is pressed, it will the buttons from overlapping
labels above them because when a button is pressed it is re-prioritized to the top layer of the layeredPane), and setting the action listeners for the
view to go to the controller, given a parameter ActionListener a. The update required methods deal with things like adding zombies, shot and plants visually
to the board, removing these visual elements from the board, and moving shots and zombies across the board. 

Operation: 	@param int on an integer used to control GUI operations
			@param BoardElement e a board element that will be affected by the associated operation

Operation is a data structure added for milestone 2. The purpose of the operation data structure is to act as the supplementary parameter
for the update method in the view (aka GameWindow). The operation class contains two main variables: operationNumber which is the number
controlling what operation it will be asking the view to do (0 = create, 1 = remove, 2 = move), and the second variable is the board element
that will be affected by this operation. So an Operation containing (1, specificZombie) will remove a specific zombie from the view.
